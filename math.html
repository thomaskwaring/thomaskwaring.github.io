  I will collect here my notes & links to any talks that I give. Please let me know if anything is incorrect or unclear, or if you have any questions!

<ul>
  <li>My <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/thesis.pdf">thesis</a>, on <em>Geometric Perspectives on Program Synthesis and Semantics</em> (October 2021). Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      We develop a formalism to apply Watanabe’s Singular Learning Theory to the problem of program synthesis. In our case, a program is a sequence of letters on the tape of a Turing Machine, which we associate to a singularity of an analytic function. The key invariant associated to a singularity in this context is the real log canonical threshold, and we introduce methods to compute this value from an ideal generated by polynomials. We provide a semantic interpretation of these singularities, which distinguishes distinct algorithms by viewing them as the limit of a learning process.
    </blockquote></li>
  <li>An <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/rlcts.pdf">informal appendix</a> to the previous, on blowing-up and calculating RLCTs.</li>

  <li> A talk on <em>regularly parametrised models</em>, to the <a href="https://metauni.org/posts/events/seminar-slt">Singular Learning Theory seminar</a> at metauni: <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/reg-talk.pdf">notes</a> (March 2022).
  </li>

  <li><a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/f-norm.pdf">Notes</a> on Girard's strong normalisation theorem for System F (polymorphic lambda-calculus). Also includes some discussion of the relationship to Gödel's incompleteness theorems and second-order Peano arithmetic, expanding on some fairly cryptic remarks in Proofs and Types. (September 2020.) I gave a talk to the <a href="https://cglseminar.github.io/">Computation, Geometry, Logic</a> seminar based on these notes (July 2021, video lost to lockdown restrictions).</li>

  <li> A <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/poster.pdf">poster</a> and <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/pomdp_ms.pdf">preprint</a>, on a partially observed model of invasive species control --- work conducted at the Melbourne Centre for Data Science. (July 2023, <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/adsn_supp.html">supplementary material</a>.) </li>

  <li> <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/young.pdf">A short note</a> on lattice paths in Young diagrams. I provide a (seemingly novel) bijective proof of an identity due to Carlitz, Roselle & Scoville, and answer explicitly an unsolved question raised in Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics.</li>

  <li>For practice and my own benefit, I am working on translating some papers from French, which I will collect here.
    <ul class="inner-space">
      <li>JP Serre's <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/gaga.pdf"><em>Géométrie algébrique et géométrie analytique</em></a> (GAGA, to his friends). I have, currently at least, skipped some of the applications for which I didn't have the necessary background. (November 2021.)</li>
      <li>"Inside every proof theorist is a sleeping bureaucrat." Jean-Yves Girard's <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/proofs.pdf">From why to how: proof theory since 1950</a>. Come for the insights, stay for the snarky footnotes. (December 2021.)</li>
    </ul>
