  <li>My <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/thesis.pdf">thesis</a>, on <em>Geometric Perspectives on Program Synthesis and Semantics</em> (October 2021). Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      We develop a formalism to apply Watanabe’s Singular Learning Theory to the problem of program synthesis. In our case, a program is a sequence of letters on the tape of a Turing Machine, which we associate to a singularity of an analytic function. The key invariant associated to a singularity in this context is the real log canonical threshold, and we introduce methods to compute this value from an ideal generated by polynomials. We provide a semantic interpretation of these singularities, which distinguishes distinct algorithms by viewing them as the limit of a learning process.
    </blockquote></li>

  <li><a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/f-norm.pdf">Notes</a> on Girard's strong normalisation theorem for System F (polymorphic lambda-calculus). Also includes some discussion of the relationship to Gödel's incompleteness theorems and second-order Peano arithmetic, expanding on some fairly cryptic remarks in Proofs and Types. (September 2020.) I gave a talk to the <a href="https://cglseminar.github.io/">Computation, Geometry, Logic</a> seminar based on these notes (July 2021, video lost temporarily to lockdown restrictions).</li>
