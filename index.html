<h1>Thomas Waring</h1>
<p>I am a final-semester MSc student at the University of Melbourne, studying pure maths. 
  I am interested in most things, but lately logic, <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/system-f.pdf" target="_blank">computation</a> and geometry.
  I also read, cook and occaisionally run long distances. My <a href="https://thomaskwaring.github.io/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> applies Watanabe's Singular Learning Theory to program synthesis, using Turing machines.
