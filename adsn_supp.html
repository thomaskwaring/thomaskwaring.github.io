<h1>Invasive Species Management: to monitor or control?</h1>

<p>This page holds supplements to a poster presented at the conference of the Australian Data Science Network (November '22).</p>

<h2>Plots</h2>

<p>The following is the primary plot from the poster, displaying the Optimal management interventions for a theoretical set of parameters (detailed below). A colourblind-friendly version is reproduced also. </p>

<p>This instance of our model considers three steps in advance, at a discount rate of \(\gamma=0.9\). Monitoring costs \(1\) unit, and has a standard error of \(0.1\). A single control action costs \(4\) units, and reduces the abundance by \(60\%\); correspondingly, controlling twice at once reduces the abundance by \(84\%\) at a cost of \(8\) units. The population is assumed to grow at an exponential rate, with growth parameter \(r = 1.2 \pm 0.05\).</p>

<h2>Model details</h2>

<p>
      Our model imitates a <em>Belief Space Markov Decision Problem.</em> To deal with the unbounded and continuous state space (species abundance), we limit the form of the managers belief. In the examples we considered, we used a lognormal distribution, so that the state space at time \(t\) is
      \[ (n_t,\Delta n_t) \in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}. \]
      Here \(n_t \pm \Delta n_t\) is an estimate of \(\log N\), where \(N = \text{disease abundance}\). For interventions that do <em>not</em> involve monitoring, the transition rule is:
      \[ n_{t+1} = n_t + r + \log(1-\rho),\quad\text{and}\quad \Delta n_{t+1} = \Delta n_t + \Delta r. \]
      For monitoring actions, \(n_{t+1}\) is sampled from the distribution defined by \((n_t,\Delta n_t)\), and \(\Delta n_{t+1}\) is determined by a Bayesian update rule. Explicitly:
      \[ n_{t+1} \sim \text{Norm}(n_t,\Delta n_t^2)\quad \text{and} \quad \Delta n_{t+1} = \frac{\Delta n_t\cdot \text{err}}{\Delta n_t + \text{err}}. \]
      The cost of each intervention is expressed in units of species abundance, so that the reward at time \(t\) with action \(a_t\) is
      \[ R_t = \mathbb{E}(N) + \text{cost}(a_t) = \exp(n_t + (\Delta n_t)^2/2) + \text{cost}(a_t). \]
      With a fixed horizon and discount factor, this MDP can be solved by the usual value iteration techniques.

<h2>Further Examples</h2>

<p>
      The simplest interesting case is over two steps, with one control and one monitoring intervention, viz:
      <img source="figs/simple_1000.png" alt="simple plot">
      We can extend this is several directions. The plot above consists of adding an extra control intervention (with residual abundance \(1-\rho = (40\%)^2 = 16\%\)), and optimizing with a horizon of three time steps. In our simple case, extending the horizon looks as follows.
      <img source="figs/simple3_1000.png" alt="the same simple plot, over 3 steps">
      With too many actions and steps, the legend becomes difficult to read, so we display a limited number of steps into the future.
</p>

<p>
      Returning to the two-step case, along with the extra control intervention as above, we can add further monitoring options. For example, the following plot allows for a combined monitoring / control action.

      This stretches in any number of directions, including varied effectiveness, costs and monitoring error.
