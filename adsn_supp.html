<h1>Invasive Species Management: to monitor or control?</h1>

<p>This page holds supplements to a poster presented at the conference of the Australian Data Science Network (November '22).</p>

<h2>Plots</h2>

<p>The following is the primary plot from the poster, displaying the Optimal management interventions for a theoretical set of parameters (detailed below). A colourblind-friendly version is reproduced also. </p>

<p>This instance of our model considers three steps in advance, at a discount rate of \(\gamma=0.9\). Monitoring costs \(1\) unit, and has a standard error of \(0.1\). A single control action costs \(4\) units, and reduces the abundance by \(60\%\); correspondingly, controlling twice at once reduces the abundance by \(84\%\) at a cost of \(8\) units. The population is assumed to grow at an exponential rate, with growth parameter \(r = 1.2 \pm 0.05\).</p>
